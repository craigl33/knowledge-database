# **General model background**

- **Regions**: A detailed plant-level model with 7 main nodes as well as
  4 out of state nodes.

- **Scenarios**: Focused on analysing the benefit of different
  flexibility options together and separately, including agricultural
  demand response, power plant flexibility, batteries and pumped storage
  hydropower.

- **Generation**: Historical capacity based on public data from the
  Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission tariff orders. Future also
  based on tariff order for new nuclear capacity being contracted with
  no new coal and gas considered. Renewable expansion based on direct
  information from the [Gujarat energy regulator
  GUVNL](https://www.guvnl.com/).

- **Demand**: Hourly historical demand was shared with us by the
  collaborating partner CER. It comes from public sources (something
  inconvenient like monthly PDFs) but they collect it for [their online
  tool](https://eal.iitk.ac.in/).

- **Transmission**: Existing lines at 400kv and above identified from
  public transmission map and limited expansion was undertaken in the
  PLEXOS model for 2030 to expand congested corridors.

- **VRE profiles**: Our GIS analysis and ERA5 weather data.

 

# **Latest project summary**

- Project description: This model was developed by Tarun Khanna (former
  intern) and finalised by Zoe to support a workshop in Gujarat that was
  part of a series of three regional workshops in India organised by the
  team (then SIR). Gujarat was the only region modelled. The modelling
  was undertaken in collaboration with the [Centre for Energy
  Regulation](https://cer.iitk.ac.in/) at IIT Kanpur, led by Anoop
  Singh.

  - Reports: the [workshop
    report](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/d74c1484-1b7c-491e-b2cf-598064e98809/IEANACER-GujaratPSTWorkshopReportfinal.pdf)
    included modelling results p15-24, and the report on [renewables
    integration in
    India](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-integration-in-india)
    also had results from the Gujarat model alongside national analysis
    (throughout).

  It's quite useful though unfortunately the more granular data is not
  made available.
