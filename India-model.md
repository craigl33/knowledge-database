# **General model background**

- **Regions**: A WEO-style model with [5 modelling
  regions](file:///S:\India\2022_WEO_India_scaled\02_MiscDocsFiguresFiles\India%20model%20structure%20diagram.pptx)
  corresponding with India's regional load dispatch centres.

- **Scenarios**: These projects have typically focused on differences
  between WEO scenarios
  [STEPS](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/stated-policies-scenario-steps)
  (formerly NPS) and
  [APS](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/announced-pledges-scenario-aps)
  (formerly SDS), transmission flows between regions, or the impacts of
  demand response. The most substantial output from this model was a
  [2021
  report](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-integration-in-india)
  that also looked at limitations to the use of transmission based on
  Available Transfer Capacities, since India is typically able to access
  much less than 100% of the transmission capacity between regions. In
  most cases the model was used for relatively small inputs to non-RISE
  reports or for commentaries and was not developed in very great
  detail.

- **Generation**: Capacity data comes from WEO. Base year regional
  splits have been assisted using the PLATTS database. While future
  splits were based on the old Indian National Electricity Plan. This is
  quite out of date but there should be a new plan available, not sure
  if it can be found online or we might need help from IEA's India desk.
  Note that India has a large amount of behind the meter generation but
  this topic is rather sensitive so we have never really dug into it.

- **Demand**: Bottom-up end-use profiles from WEO, regional splits were
  also based on the National Electricity Plan long term perspective.

- **Transmission**: Based originally on National Electricity Plan long
  term transmission perspective. [This
  report](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/notification/2022/12/CEA_Tx_Plan_for_500GW_Non_fossil_capacity_by_2030.pdf)
  provides more recent values. There is also data on Available Transfer
  Capacities available here.

- **VRE profiles**: Based on our own GIS analysis and ERA5 data. If the
  model is updated it could be ideal to harmonise with the WEO
  generation profiles.

 

# **Latest project summary**

- Project rationale: a minor update scaling the demand and generation to
  match AnnexA data that was used for an article on demand response.

# **Previous projects summary**

- EV commentary

  - Project description: minor project to prepare a [commentary on EVs
    and solar in
    India](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/how-can-smart-charging-steer-electric-vehicle-uptake-in-india).
    Originally prepared as an extension to the 2021 model (WEO 2020) but
    publication was delayed and the model used was the updated scaling
    version.

  - Locations and files: shares a folder and input data with the
    digitalisation article, [modelling xml is
    here](file:///S:\India\2022_WEO_India_scaled\03_Modelling\India_2022_WEO_v0.6_add%20new%20transmission.xml).

- Digitalisation article

  - Project description: minor project to prepare a commentary on demand
    response for EMDE. The same model as the EV commentary provides one
    figure to illustrate the impact of flexibility demand in the Indian
    power sector.

  - Publication: [Using Digitalisation in Emerging Markets and
    Developing Economies to Enable Demand Response in
    Buildings](https://www.iea.org/reports/using-digitalisation-in-emerging-markets-and-developing-economies-to-enable-demand-response-in-buildings)

- 2021 renewable integration report and WEO India outlook. The [project
  is labelled WEO 2020](file:///S:\India\2020_WEO_India) because it was
  based on WEO 2020 results.

  - Project description: a fairly substantial update was done for input
    into the report [Renewables Integration in
    India](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-integration-in-india)
    that also included results from the Gujarat model. Since we were
    updating the model we also provided input into the WEO special
    report [India Energy Outlook
    2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/india-energy-outlook-2021).

  - Locations and files: this project has the [data folder on the G:
    drive](file:///G:\DOCS\04%20PROJECTS\COUNTRIES\INDIA\03%20Projects\modelling\WEO%20India%20modelling%202020\06_Data).
    Modelling folder, generator parameters sheet, load sheet.

- The main model setup was done in 2018 to support the WEO electricity
  focus

  - [Report is
    here](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2018), the
    analysis based on the model is on p380-383

  - Modelling [project folder is here](file:///S:\India\2018_WEO_India).

- There was a smaller project earlier in 2018 to support the ETP future
  of cooling report

  - [Report is here](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling),

  - Modelling [project folder is
    here](file:///S:\India\2018_ETP_cooling).
