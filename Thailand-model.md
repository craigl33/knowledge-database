# **General model background**

- **Regions**: 5 regions (Central (CAC), Metropolitan Bangkok (MAC),
  Northern (NAC), North-Eastern (NEC), Southern (SAC) or 7 regions

- **Scenarios**: Thailand CET


| Scenario| Year| Description|
| :------: | :------: | ------ |
|    Validation    |    2021    | Historical capacity mix|
|    Base    |     2025<br>2030<br>2037   | Capacity mix based on PDP 2018 revision 1|
| VRE Plus | 2030<br>2037| The capacity mix deviates from the Base scenario with accelerated VRE deployment to meet Thailand's emissions target. This includes the removal of 6.9 GW of uncommitted thermal generation that would have come online between 2030 and 2037.<br>Different flexibility options (grid expansion, storage, power plant flexibility and smart charging EVs) are also explored in order to assess their benefit for accommodating higher shares of VRE. |

- **Description from Thailand CET:** The Thailand power system was
  modelled using both the production cost and capacity expansion
  modelling functionality in PLEXOS © Integrated Energy Model.5 This is
  an industry standard, optimisation-based power system modelling tool
  that allows for both detailed production cost modelling and long-term
  capacity expansion modelling. The following description of the model
  pertains to single representation of the Thailand power system that is
  consistent for the use of both functionalities within the model,
  although additional information is provided for the long-term capacity
  expansion functionality in the next section.

- The model employs a temporal resolution of an hour, using forecasted
  hourly demand profiles as provided by EPPO, while the techno-economic
  characteristics of power plants (including imports), hydropower energy
  constraints, VRE production profiles, fuel supply constraints,
  operating reserves, transmission lines and are also represented.

- Thailand’s power system is represented in the model according to the
  main “area control” regions designated by the EGAT. These comprise
  five main control regions, and a further disaggregation of the Central
  region based on EGAT operational procedures due to its large size. The
  model represents Thailand based on five main control regions within
  EGAT, corresponding with the spatial disaggregation of demand data
  provided by EGAT:

| Data source| Generation| Transmission network| Demand|
| :------: | ------ | ------ |------ |
|    Official source (i.e. EGAT)|    Net capacity per generation technology (existing / planned) <br>•Key operating characteristics of generating plants: average heat rates for existing plants <br>•Fuel costs for current and future years <br>•Daily gas take-or-pay contracts <br>•Fuel prices <br>•Hydro energy constraints| • Existing and  future network topology (lines/voltage) for Thailand (split into 5 nodes) |•Forecasted hourly demand profiles for 2021 , 2025, 2030 and 2037 <br>•Energy efficiency and EV projections per region <br>•EV charging hourly profiles |
|    Public domain or  IEA data/analysis |     •Wind & solar time series for representative locations for the future scenarios.   | | | 
| Global data assumed | •Key operating characteristics of generating plants: ramp rates, min/max generation, average heat rate of future plants, min up/down times |  | |

- **Modelling**:

  - Capacity expansion, whereby the optimal amount of VRE and
    flexibility options(inter-regional grid reinforcement, storage) are
    found in order to meet Thailand’s emissions targets in the modelled
    years.

  - Production cost model, to explore the flexibility requirements
    around increased VRE production and the benefits of different
    flexibility options. This model is deterministic, using only a
    single weather year and a single set of outage patterns for
    generators. It is therefore unable to appropriately assess system
    adequacy
